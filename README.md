This repository contains the code written as part of the [Neo4j NODES 2024](https://neo4j.com/nodes2024/agenda/) talk "[Creating Awesome Graph Visualization With the Neo4j Visualization Library NVL](https://neo4j.com/nodes2024/agenda/creating-awesome-graph-visualization-with-the-neo4j-visualization-library-nvl/)". It makes use of the [NVL boilerplates](https://github.com/neo4j-devtools/nvl-boilerplates).
